# -_Homemade_-Password-Manager-and-Generator-with-cpp17-
This is one of my portofolio projects. Here I made a console application via CodeBlocks::IDE 20.03. Please use all the files added in this repo.

The language in which the output in the code is written is romanian, not english. In a future update I will make the code english-compatible.

PS: the AES-256 crypting method is put in comments in the code because it uses the external library Crypto++. If you already have downloaded Crypto++ on your PC, you can use AES-256. Otherwise, leave it as it is.
